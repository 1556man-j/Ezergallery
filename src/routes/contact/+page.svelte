				Reaching out is the first step toward connection  and every connection matters. Whether you
				are a brand looking to collaborate, an art lover drawn to the stories behind each image, or
				someone simply moved by emotion and light, this space is open to you. At EZERGALLERY,
				communication is more than just exchanging messages; it’s about listening, understanding,
				and building something meaningful together.
			</p>
			<p class="text-[20px] leading-7">
				Photography, at its core, is about relationships  between the artist and the subject,
				between the story and the viewer. That same belief shapes the way I approach every message Igi
				receive. When you reach out, know that your words are read with care and intention. I value
				your time, your curiosity, and your trust.
			</p>
			<p class="text-[20px] leading-7">
				So, tell me your story. What do you envision? What are you hoping to create, capture, or
				express? Whether it’s a collaboration, commission, or personal inquiry, your message is the
				beginning of something new. I’ll do my best to respond as soon as possible and help bring
				your ideas to life in a way that feels true and honest.
			</p>
			<p class="text-[20px] leading-7">
				Let’s start the conversation. I’m excited to hear from you  because every message here
				isn’t just a form submission, it’s an invitation to create something beautiful together.
